# Medical Store Managment Software

This is a medical store management software written in java. Swing is used to create GUI for the application. I have also added feature of logging in this using multi-threading so concurrently write logs to a text file for easy monitoring. For the backend I have used MYSQL database.

1. First you will need to have JDK 11 or later installed. 
2. You will also need to MYSQL installed and configured.
3. Just change the credentials and schema in all the java source files where a JDBC connection is made. 
4. After following the above steps you will be easily be able to run the medical store management software.
